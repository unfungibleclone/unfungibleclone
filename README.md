Hi, Iâ€™m @unfungibleclone

I am interested in coding, web3 space, new tech that improves the world (and helps pay down the mortgage)

I am currently learnig Python and looking to collaborate on projects.

Decades ago I started coding (logo, pascal, vba, c++) but worked in other industries until now (cook, chemical engineer, real estate consultant, financial advisor). 

ðŸš‚ I started using Excel in 1995
