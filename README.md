# Brien Giuntini - Additional background relating to Data Analysis   

## Summary
Hi, I'm Brien.  I am a methodical, analytical and future driven individual with a degree in engineering, but I lost my way and ended up in a corporate real estate environment for a couple of decades.   I developed interpersonal and soft skills whilst working with multi-cultural teams across Europe as well as gained experience in negotiations, marketing and combatting internal politics.  

Having been a cook for a number of years and working in a deal driven environment, I am accustomed to high pressure situations with aggressive deadlines.  I understand that all the work needs to be done and pull my weight be it leading a negotiation or updating a database.  

Keen problem solver and curious about the underlying data and unintended consequences. I don’t have all the answers. but I will either search until I find them or work through trial-and-error until reaching a suitable solution.

Passionate about finance and technology that can improve the financial wellbeing of the general population instead of products that drive institutional fee revenue.

Strong aptitude towards learning new skills and sharing them with the team to elevate the business.

I hold a MBA in International Hospitality Management from Cornell/ESSEC and a BSc in Chemical Engineering from Tulane University
